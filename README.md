# tournament-scoring
My old GCSE assignment program focused around a system to submit scores for a tournament. (I made this 5 years ago, I just needed a place to store it).

The brief for the assignment is as follows:
> You are a junior employee at a small software development company. Your company recently visited a local college and delivered a guest lecture. The college were pleased with the outcome of the visit and have asked your company to judge an upcoming tournament.
> 
> The college will be running a tournament for students to compete in a series of events for prizes. 
> •    Participants may enter the tournament as individuals or as part of a team 
> •    It is expected that will be 4 teams each with 5 members and there will be 20 spaces for individual competitors 
> •    Each team or individual will complete 5 events 
> •    Each event will be defined as a team or individual event 
> •    The events will vary in type, from sporting to academic challenges 
> •    Individuals and teams will be awarded points according to their rank within each event 
> •    The points awarded for each event are as yet undecided and the college are willing to hear any suggestions you may have
> •    Also the college would like to include the possibility of entering for one event only
> 
> You have been asked to design and develop a computer program to manage the scoring system for the tournament.

The program is ran entirely through "tournament scoring.py" with references to "team scores.txt" and "individual scores.txt" within it.
